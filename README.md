# python-carbon-client

This project aims to be an unofficial `python` wrapper client to interact with [CarbonInterface API](http://carboninterface.com).

The _CarbonInterface API_ is an API to calculate carbon (CO₂) emissions estimates for common CO₂ emitting activities.

More functionality is going to be added soon.
